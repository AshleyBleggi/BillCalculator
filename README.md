# BillCalculator
Easily estimate a water bill across any part of California with OWRS compliant water rate data specified. OWRS bill calculator refactoring tool of same name from MNWD. 

## Winter Internship Goals

Develop a bill calculator leveraging Open Water Rate Specification (OWRS) data. This tool would allow users to put in their address and water use for a given month and see the estimated bill for that month. Extensions include comparing that to other water utilities. 

The MNWD_BillCalculator folder contains code from one specific utility. The goal of this winter sprint is to refactor and generalize that utility-specific code for use with any OWRS file from any local water retailer. A preliminary timeline for the project is shown below:
